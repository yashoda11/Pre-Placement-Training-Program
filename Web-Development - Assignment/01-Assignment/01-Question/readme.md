# **Web Development Assignment - 01**
## **Question - 01 :**

**1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`** **is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?**

**Answer - 01 :**
- All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
- The declaration is not an HTML tag.
- It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
- This tells browsers what version of HTML the web page was coded in, which helps them to know how to process the code.
