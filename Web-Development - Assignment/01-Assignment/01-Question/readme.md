# **Web Development Assignment - 01**
## **Question - 01 :**

**1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?**

**Answer :**
- All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
- The declaration is not an HTML tag.
- It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
- This tells browsers what version of HTML the web page was coded in, which helps them to know how to process the code.
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` is not a tag in HTML. It is called a **document type declaration**, or **doctype** for short. 
- It is used to **declare** the **version** of **HTML** that the web page is written in.
- The doctype declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. 
- It informs the **web browser** about the **type** of **markup language** used in the document, which helps the browser to interpret and render the page correctly.
- In the case of `<!DOCTYPE html>`, it is the doctype declaration for HTML5, which is the latest version of HTML. 
- This declaration tells the browser to interpret the document as HTML5 and use the appropriate rendering rules and features.
- The doctype declaration is important because different versions of HTML have different syntax rules and features.
- By specifying the correct doctype, you ensure that the web page is rendered consistently across different browsers and devices, and that it follows the standards set by the HTML specification.
