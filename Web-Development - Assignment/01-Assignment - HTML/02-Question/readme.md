**Semantic Tags :**
- A Semantic tag clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. 

- **For Example :**
    - In **Non-Semantic elements** like `<div>` and `<span>` they **tell nothing** about its **content**.

- **For Example :**
    - In **Semantic elements** like `<form>`, `<table>` and `<article>` **clearly** defines its **content**.
    
- The following **Semantic tags** in **HTML** can be used to break our page into identified parts :

    **1. `<header>` :**
    - It defines a header of a web page.
    
    **2. `<nav>` :**
    - It defines a container for navigation links.

    **3.`<section>` :**
    - This defines a section in a webpage.

    **4.`<article>` :**
    - This element contains the main part, containing the information about the webpage.

    **5.`<aside>` :**
    - This content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
    
    **6. `<main>` :** 
    - Represents the main content area of a document.

    **7.`<footer>` :**
    - It defines a footer for a document or a section.

    **8. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` :** 
    - Used together to group media content, such as images or videos, along with their captions.
