**3. Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?**


**ANSWER :**


**HTML Tag :** 
- An **HTML Tag** surrounds the content and applies meaning to it.
- An HTML tag is a markup symbol or syntax used to define the structure and behavior of elements within an HTML document. 
- Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and are placed around HTML elements to define their start and end points.

**Example :**
```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
``` 
- In the above example, `<p>` and `</p>` are the opening and closing tags, respectively, used to define the start and end of the <p> element.


**HTML Elements :** 
- An **HTML Element** is an individual component of an HTML file.
- In an HTML file, everything written within tags are termed as HTML elements.
- An HTML element consists of the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. 
- It represents a specific part of a web page's structure or content. 
- Elements are made up of tags, attributes, and the content placed between the opening and closing tags.

**Example :**
```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
In this example, `<p>` is the opening tag, `</p>` is the closing tag, and "This is a paragraph." is the content of the <p> element.
