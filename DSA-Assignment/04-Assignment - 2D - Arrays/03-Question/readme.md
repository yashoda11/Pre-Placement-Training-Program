# **Assignment - 04**
## **Question 3**
Given a 2D integer array matrix, return *the **transpose** of* matrix.
- The **transpose** of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

**Example :**

**Input :** matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

**Output :** [ [1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]

**Explanation :**
- Let *M* be the number of cells in the matrix.
- **Time complexity :** O(*M*), as each cell is getting read once and written once.
- **Space complexity :** O(1) because we do not use any other additional data structures.
