## **Question 5**
Given an integer array nums, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the maximum product.

**Example 1:**

**Input :** nums = [1,2,3]

**Output :** 6

**Explanation :**
- First, We have to sort the array.
- Now, we have to the take the last three numbers of the sorted array whose product is maximum.
- Return the Maximum Product.
- **Time Complexity :**
    - Here, we have sorted the array.
    - Hence, The Time Complexity is : `O(NlogN)`.
- **Space Complexity :**
    - Here, We did not take any extra spaces.
    - So, the Space Complexity is : `O(1)`.
