## **Question - 07**

Given aÂ **Doubly Linked List**, the task is to reverse the given Doubly Linked List.

**Example :**
```
Original Linked list 10 8 4 2
Reversed Linked list 2 4 8 10
```

**Explanation :**
- The code defines a Node class to represent each node in the doubly linked list. 
- The reverseDoublyLinkedList function reverses the given doubly linked list by swapping the prev and next pointers for each node. 
- The displayList function is used to display the original and reversed linked lists.
- The original doubly linked list 10 <-> 8 <-> 4 <-> 2 is reversed to 2 <-> 4 <-> 8 <-> 10.
