## **Question - 08**

Given an array, find a product of all array elements.

**Example 1:**

Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output : 120

**Example 2:**

Input  : arr[] = {1, 6, 3}
Output : 18

**Explanation :**
- In this code, the getProduct function takes an array arr as input.
- Inside the function, we initialize a variable product to 1, which will store the product of all elements.
- Then, we iterate through the array using a for loop. 
- For each element, we multiply it with the product variable and update the product variable with the new value.
- After iterating through all elements, we return the final value of the product variable, which represents the product of all array elements.
- In the example usage, we call the getProduct function with two different arrays and log the output to the console. 
- The output will be the product of all elements in the respective arrays: 120 and 18.
